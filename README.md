# ðŸŒ¿ Serious Game â€“ VR Nature & Cognitive Therapy for Elderly

## Note Taking

### What is a Serious Game?

A **serious game** is a game designed for purposes beyond pure entertainment. It integrates elements of gameplay with real world applications such as education, healthcare, training, or research. These games are interactive experiences that aim to **educate, inspire, or facilitate behavioral and cognitive development** while maintaining an engaging format. By leveraging the immersion and motivation that games provide, serious games can help users absorb information or undergo therapy in a more natural and enjoyable way.

### What Are We Working On?

We are developing a **virtual reality (VR) game experience** tailored for individuals with **dementia** or **elderly people with limited physical mobility**. The goal is to offer a **soothing, immersive connection with nature** something many users may no longer have access to in real life.

This VR game aims to:

- Provide **therapeutic exposure to nature** using virtual environments like forests.
- Stimulate **cognitive functions** through simple and intuitive interaction based mini games.
- Offer a sense of **relaxation, memory stimulation, and physical engagement** via hand gestures.

### How Does the Game Work?

The experience begins when the player puts on a **Meta Quest 2 VR headset** and is transported into a **peaceful forest environment**.

As they enter the virtual world, the player is welcomed by:
- A **friendly cat companion** that appears at the start.
- **Calm and soothing background music** to promote relaxation.
- A scenic environment featuring **glowing sunflowers** and a beautiful **sunset sky**, designed to bring joy and a sense of wonder.

While exploring this environment, the player encounters **simple interactive mini-games** intended to activate memory and motor skills. One such game is a **shape-matching activity**:

- The game displays a shape (e.g., circle, square) in front of the player.
- The player is encouraged to **replicate the shape using hand gestures**.
- For example, when a **circle** appears, the player forms a **fist** with their hand to match it.
- Shapes may appear in different **orientations**, prompting the player to use:
  - Left or right hand
  - Hands rotated upside down
  - Varying hand positions
- The game provides **feedback** based on how well the player's hand matches the shape, encouraging coordination and cognitive stimulation.

###  Tools & Technologies Used

We are utilizing the following tools to bring this project to life:

- **Unity** â€“ Game engine for developing immersive VR experiences.
- **Blender** â€“ 3D modeling and animation software for creating forest assets and game objects.
- **Meta Quest 2** â€“ VR headset used for testing and deploying the game, with hand-tracking capabilities.
