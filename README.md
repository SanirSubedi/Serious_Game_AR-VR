# üåø Serious Game ‚Äì VR Nature & Cognitive Therapy for Elderly

## üìù Note Taking

### What is a Serious Game?

A **serious game** is a game designed for purposes beyond pure entertainment. It integrates elements of gameplay with real-world applications such as education, healthcare, training, or research. These games are interactive experiences that aim to **educate, inspire, or facilitate behavioral and cognitive development** while maintaining an engaging format. By leveraging the immersion and motivation that games provide, serious games can help users absorb information or undergo therapy in a more natural and enjoyable way.

### What Are We Working On?

We are developing a **virtual reality (VR) game experience** tailored for individuals with **dementia** or **elderly people with limited physical mobility**. The goal is to offer a **soothing, immersive connection with nature**‚Äîsomething many users may no longer have access to in real life.

This VR game aims to:

- Provide **therapeutic exposure to nature** using virtual environments like forests.
- Stimulate **cognitive functions** through simple and intuitive interaction-based mini-games.
- Offer a sense of **relaxation, memory stimulation, and physical engagement** via hand gestures.

### How Does the Game Work?

The experience begins with the player (a dementia patient or elderly person) putting on a **Meta Quest 2 VR headset** and entering a calming **forest environment**.

While virtually ‚Äúwalking‚Äù through the forest, the player encounters **simple interactive mini-games** designed to activate memory and motor skills. One such game is a **shape-matching activity**:

- The game displays a shape (e.g., circle, square) in front of the player.
- The player is encouraged to **replicate the shape using their hand gestures**.
- For example, when a **circle** appears, the player forms a **fist** with their hand to match it.
- Shapes may appear in different **orientations**, requiring the player to use:
  - Left or right hand
  - Hands rotated upside down
  - Varying hand positions
- Feedback is given based on how well the player's hand matches the shape, promoting **active thinking and coordination**.
